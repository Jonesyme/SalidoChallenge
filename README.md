iOS Coding Challenge
Author: Mike Jones

From a technical stand-point, the challenge was not overtly difficult or complex but the sheer number of custom views and tables required to achieve the full feature set was quite large - at least, in my experience.  Given another 48 hours I would be happy to finish out the features but in the interest of time I have reduced the scope to the features outlined below.  If you have any questions or you'd like to see me code a feature that's not in the current solution, don't be afraid to ask.
