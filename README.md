iOS Coding Challenge
Author: Mike Jones

OK.  From a technical stand-point, the challenge was not overtly difficult or complex but the sheer number of views and tables required to achieve the full feature set was rather large - at least in my experience.  Given another 48 hours I likely could have finished out the features but in the interest of time I have reduced the scope to the features outlined below.

## Compilation Notes
- Compiles on: XCode 8.3.2
- Language: Objective-C
- Target Device Family: iPad Only
- Target Orientation: Landscape Only
- Target OS: iOS 10.3

## What Features are Working
- Almost all the Employee Account/PIN features
    - Create account
    - Search accounts
    - Login with PIN
- The Wine Search and Filter Screen
    - Tap filter button to filter by any Category using slide-out menu
    - Use the search bar to query wines via text

## Whats Missing (Unfortunitely)
- All shopping cart functionality
- Sorting/paging of search results
- Unit Tests

## 3rd Party Libraries Used
- JSONJoy for mapping data models to JSON responses
- SWRevealViewController for slide-out master-detail like view hierarchy on search screen
