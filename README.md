iOS Coding Challenge

OK.  From a technical stand-point, the challenge was not overtly difficult or complex but the sheer number of views and tables required to achieve the full feature set was rather large - at least in my experience.  Given another 48 hours I likely could have finished out the features but in the interest of time I have reduced the scope a bit the features outlines below.
